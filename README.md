# Code Refactor Starter Code

On this project I took on the challenge of up updating the stater code for the Horiseon landing page.


Some things that were changed on this webpage were:
1. Updating the html code with semantic html emlements to help the browser and other developers understand what the website does.
2. Replaced "div" tags in the body with "article" and "section" tags
3. Replaced the child "div" tags that help the content off to the side with "aside" tags 
4. Merged rules in the stylesheet to reduce any duplicate codes and help keep the stylesheet neat and organized.
5. Rearranged the code on the stylesheet to better reflect the flow of code in the html file.
6. Ensure all links on the html work and navigate to the correct locations.
7. Added html and css comments to help the browser and other developers understand the code and it's functions.
