# Code Refactor Starter Code

On this project I took on the challenge of up updating the stater code for the Horiseon landing page.

## Some things that were changed on this webpage were:
*Updating the html code with semantic html emlements to help the browser and other developers understand what the website does.
*Replaced <div> tags in the body with <article> and <section> tags
*Replaced the child <div> tags that help the content off to the side with <aside> tags 
*Merged rules in the stylesheet to reduce any duplicate codes and help keep the stylesheet neat and organized.
*Rearranged the code on the stylesheet to better reflect the flow of code in the html file.
*Ensure all links on the html work and navigate to the correct locations.
*Added html and css comments to help the browser and other developers understand the code and it's functions.
